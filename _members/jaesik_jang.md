Jaesik Jang is currently pursuing a B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Yonsei University and is scheduled to graduate in August 2026. Deeply interested in the entire spectrum of computer systems, he places particular emphasis on memory hierarchies and next-generation architectures such as Compute Express Link (CXL) and Processing-In-Memory (PIM). He aims to advance cutting-edge computer systems by designing novel hardware architectures capable of supporting emerging large-scale AI models.
