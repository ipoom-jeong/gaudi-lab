## Research Topics

Our research topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

{% capture text %}

### **Computer System Architectures and Resource Orchestration**

Modern computer systems have become larger and more complex, underscoring the need for designing highly efficient system architectures and effectively orchestrating shared resources, such as memory and Last-Level Cache (LLC). We are investigating cutting-edge systems and exploring diverse solutions to improve system-wide processing efficiency.

### **CPU Core Microarchitectures and Multi-core Architectures**

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) plays a crucial role in a system by running applications and system software, managing system resources, interacting with I/O devices, _etc_. We are exploring advanced microarchitectural techniques (_e.g._, dynamic scheduling and speculation) and novel multi-core architectures (_e.g._, heterogeneous multi-core and simultaneous multi-threading architectures) to improve the performance and energy efficiency of the CPU.
