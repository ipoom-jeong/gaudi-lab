## Research Topics

Our research topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

{% capture text %}

### **Computer System Architectures and Resource Orchestration**

Modern computer systems have become larger and more complex, underscoring the need for designing highly efficient system architectures and effectively orchestrating shared resources, such as memory and Last-Level Cache (LLC). We are investigating cutting-edge systems and exploring diverse solutions to improve system-wide processing efficiency.

### **CPU Core Microarchitectures and Multi-core Architectures**

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) plays a vital role in a system by running applications and system software, managing system resources, interacting with I/O devices, _etc_. We are exploring advanced microarchitectural techniques, such as dynamic scheduling and speculation, as well as innovative multi-core architectures like heterogeneous multi-core and simultaneous multi-threading, to enhance the CPU's performance and energy efficiency.
