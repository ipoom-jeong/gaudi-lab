### **Computer System Architectures and Resource Orchestration**

Modern computer systems have become larger and more complex, highlighting the critical need for designing highly efficient system architectures and effectively orchestrating shared resources, such as memory and last-level cache (LLC). We are investigating state-of-the-art systems and exploring diverse solutions to improve system-wide processing efficiency.
