## Research Topics

Our research topics include, _but are not limited to_, the following areas:

{% capture text %}

### **Computer System Architectures and Resource Orchestration**

Modern computer systems have become larger and more complex, underscoring the need for designing highly efficient system architectures and effectively orchestrating shared resources, such as memory and Last-Level Cache (LLC). We are investigating cutting-edge systems and exploring diverse solutions to improve system-wide processing efficiency.

### **CPU Core Microarchitectures and Multi-core Architectures**

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) plays a vital role in a system by running applications and system software, managing system resources, interacting with I/O devices, _etc_. We are exploring advanced microarchitectural techniques, such as dynamic scheduling and speculation, as well as innovative multi-core architectures like heterogeneous multi-core and simultaneous multi-threading, to enhance the CPU's performance and energy efficiency.

### **GPGPU and Accelerator Architectures**

Emerging applications with diverse computation patterns have driven the development of specialized hardware designed to deliver optimal performance per watt for these tasks. We are exploring energy-efficient architectures for General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) and Neural Processing Units (NPUs) while also investigating use cases for on-chip accelerators.

### **Emerging Interconnect Technologies**

Compute eXpress Link (CXL) is an open standard for high-speed, efficient interconnect between CPUs and other devices like memory, accelerators (_e.g._, GPUs, FPGAs), and SmartNICs (Network Interface Cards). It's designed to improve performance and resource sharing in data centers, particularly in large-scale computing, AI, and machine learning environments.
